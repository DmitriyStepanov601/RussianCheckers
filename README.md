# RussianCheckers

Russian draughts is a traditional and most popular type of draughts in Russia, the former Soviet Union and Israel. The goal of the game is to 
deprive the opponent of the opportunity to move by taking or locking all his checkers (in reverse Russian checkers, the goal is the opposite — 
to deprive yourself of the opportunity to move).

Distinctive features:
- Checkers move only on dark-colored cells.
- The board is positioned so that the corner field at the bottom left of the player's side is dark.
- A simple checker hits back and forth, a king moves and hits any field diagonally.
- During the battle, a simple checker can turn into a king and immediately continue the fight according to the rules of the king.
- If there are several battle options, you can choose any of them.
